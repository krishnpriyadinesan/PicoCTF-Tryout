*Insp3ct0r*
First I checked what was provided in the link given. So in that site on top it was written inspect me and I did. When I checked the sources, parts of the flag was in three different codes. Took each part of the flag one by one and arranged and yes I did get the correct flag.

*where are the robots*
At first when i opened the link i couldnt find anything. Even i checked the page source but i had no clue. Later i checked the clue for this task and it was-What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?Reading this I remembered reading about robots.txt file which prevents the search enignes or web robots to see certain parts of a website. So I added the extension and then the screen showed User-agent: * ,Disallow: /1bb4c.html. So in this actually disallow tells robot to not visit it. Then i replaced /robots.txt with /1bb4c.html and I got the flag.

*dont-use-client-side*
I checked the page and looked for any clue but there wasnt any. Then later I inspected the page and checked each codes. I found in javascript that there was series of if statements and noticed the word "pico". So this one was purely my guesswork. I just rearranged the whole thing and got the flag.
